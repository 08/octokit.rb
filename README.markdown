## TODO

1. Repo API
2. Network API
3. Commit API
4. Object API

## Note on Patches/Pull Requests
 
* Fork the project.
* Make your feature addition or bug fix.
* Add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a
  future version unintentionally.
* Commit, do not mess with rakefile, version, or history.
  (if you want to have your own version, that is fine but
   bump version in a commit by itself I can ignore when I pull)
* Send me a pull request. Bonus points for topic branches.

## Credits

Octopussy is inspired by [Octopi](http://github.com/fcoury/octopi) and aims to be a lightweight, less active-resourcey alternative.
